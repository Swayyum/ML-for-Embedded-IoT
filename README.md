In this course, we will review the fundamentals of machine learning and learn how to deploy machine learning
methods into energy-constrained devices that form the Internet of Things (IoT). By the end of the course, you
should:
1. Be familiar with the key concepts of machine learning and deep neural networks.
2. Understand the computational burden and hardware requirements of different machine learning architectures
3. Be aware of the most popular frameworks for developing neural networks.
4. Be able to use available software frameworks to port deep neural networks to microcontrollers
